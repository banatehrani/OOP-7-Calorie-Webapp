### Object Oriented Programming App 7: Calorie Web App

- **Description**: This app gets from the user his/her weight, height,
age, city and country, then scrapes the temperature of the user's location
and calculates how many calories the user needs. 
The website `https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/` is scraped 
for finding the temperature in this app. Then `Flask` is used
and a web interface is created for the app.

- **Structure**: The basic design of this app is available
in`design.txt`. The `static` folder contains `main.css`
and the `templates`
folder contains `calories_form_page.html` and `index.html`.
